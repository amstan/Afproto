Afproto - Arduino Library
=======

***
UNTESTED!
***


This is a simple arduino wrapper of the embedded_c afproto library. In
order to compile and use it in arduino you should copy the contents of
this directory to <sketchbook_dir>/libraries/Afproto. Then copy the
embedded_c directory to <sketchbook_dir>/libraries/Afproto as well.

Examples are included in the Afproto directory.

(TODO: include usage instructions...)
